# woodworking-cut-sheet
This project will help you layout your cut list from a base board. 

This program is meant for dividing a sheet of plywood (of any size) into portions based on whatever size boards you have. 

Termonology:
sheet: this is the plywood sheet that you are attempting to cut up
board: this is the sizes of wood you want to cut the plywood into

rotation: a board can be oriented width/length or length/width (if rotation is False the shorter side comes first)
          True : shorter side is horizontal
          False : shorter side is vertical

claimed: a portion of the sheet is claimed when a board is cut from the sheet
